# Description of this simulation
description: "Example description"

# Prefix of output file(s) path. For binary format, a single file <output-prefix>.bin will be written.
# When using PDB, three files will be generated:
#   * <output-prefix>.pdb - main PDB output file. It will contain frames with all the atoms except the lamins.
#   * <output-prefix>-lamin.pdb - file containing one frame with the lamins
#   * <output-prefix>.meta - PDB metadata
output-prefix: example-out

# The number of simulation steps, i. e. how many atom moves will be attempted.
steps: 1000

# Whether to write intermediate simulation steps to the main PDB file. If True every accepted move will
# generate a frame in the PDB file. If False only the last frame will be written.
write-intermediate-frames: False

# Whether to print callback names (prints only the results if False).
verbose-callbacks: True

# Generates different ("simple") mapping for energy vectors and binder types.
# The mapping won't be a bijection if used with 3 or more binder types. Not recommended.
simple-pdb-output: False

# Use binary output format.
binary-output: True

# In binary output format, how many delta frames should be between full keyframes
frames-per-keyframe: 1000

# A list of enabled callback names.
# Builtin callback names: "Standard Score", "Gyration Radius" (without quotes).
enabled-callbacks:
    - Standard Score

# The used internal representation.
# representation: IOChain

# The used score function.
# score: StandardScore

# A predicate determining whether a bead should be frozen or not.
# Grammar:
#
#   expr ::= literal | literal,expr
#   literal ::= term | !literal
#   term ::= (expr) | rangeOrWildcard | rangeOrWildcard:rangeOrWildcard
#   rangeOrWildcard = * | integer | integer-integer
#
# "!" denotes negation, "," denotes alternative, "*" matches everything.
#
# Examples:
#
#   - "2:1-100,9" freezes beads from 1 to 100 on the chain 2, and also the whole chain 9
#   - "*:0" freezes the 0th bead of every chain
#   - "!(4,5)" freezes everything except for chains 4 and 5
# freeze-predicate: "1:1-100,2:*"

# Description for random initial state generation. Comment out this section if you want
# to load the initial state from PDB files.

    # The description of different chain features, each feature corresponding to a BED file.

        - feat0.bed

    # Lengths of the chains.
    chain-lengths:

    # Numbers of binders of each type excluding lamins. Each type corresponds to a BED file provided above
    # starting the second (if exists). The first file corresponds to the lamin type.
    binders-counts:
        - 1000

    # The radius of the cell in which the simulation takes place.
    radius: 10

    # The resolution used to convert BED files to chains.
    resolution: 10

    # Used internally to limit the number of failed attempts when generating a random initial state.
    # Try a higher value if the initialisation fails too often.
    initialisation-attempts: 10000
